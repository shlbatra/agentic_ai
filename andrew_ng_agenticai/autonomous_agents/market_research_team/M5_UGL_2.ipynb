    "### 1.1. Lab Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will step into the role of a **technical AI lead at a fashion brand** preparing a summer sunglasses campaign. Your task is to design a **fully automated creative pipeline** that mirrors a real-world business scenario. Instead of handling each piece manually, you will guide a system that scans online sources for emerging fashion trends, matches those trends with sunglasses in the internal catalog, designs a campaign visual, generates a short marketing quote, and finally packages everything into an **executive-ready report**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to experience how multiple agents, tools, and models can be orchestrated into a single, coherent workflow. By the end of this lab, you will have built a pipeline that feels less like a script of isolated steps and more like a small team working together to solve a creative challenge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. 🎯 Learning outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will see how to move beyond single-turn interactions with a model and instead design **multi-agent pipelines** that coordinate planning, research, and creative generation. You will learn how to ground agent reasoning in external tools so that outputs are not just imaginative but also supported by real data. You will also experiment with reflection and packaging steps that enforce quality control and prepare results for an executive audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this lab is about learning how to combine the **imagination of large language models** with the **discipline of structured workflows**, giving you a practical pattern for building autonomous systems that are both creative and reliable.  "

       "   • Sculptural Cat-Eye &amp; Retro Silhouettes  \n",
       "     ­– The ’50s/’60s “feline” shape is resurging as a power accessory—elegant, feminine, statement-making.  \n",
       "   • Minimal “Barely There” Frames  \n",
       "     ­– Ultra-lightweight metal and slim rims deliver a modern, understated look that lets lens colors (tints/gradients) pop.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Recommended Catalog Items  \n",
       "   • SG004 “Sport” Wraparound  \n",
       "     ­– Single curved lens, rubber grips, lightweight flexible frame. Perfect match for the sporty-futuristic shield trend.  \n",
       "   • SG003 “Mystique” (Cat-Eye)  \n",
       "     ­– Upswept corners, subtle embellishment at the temples. Captures the sculptural retro moment.  \n",
       "   • SG005 “Round” Minimalist  \n",
       "     ­– Circular lenses in a slim frame, clean lines. Ideal for the barely-there trend—can be styled with tinted or gradient lenses to amplify summer color.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Justification for Summer Campaign  \n",
       "   – All three styles directly reflect what fashion editors and influencers are spotlighting for SS25: technical silhouettes, nods to vintage glam, and minimalist metals.  \n",

The first wears SG004 “Sport” Wraparound: a single, curved neon-blue lens with matte black rubber grips and a flexible, ultra-light gray frame, evoking a futuristic, high-energy vibe. The second rocks SG003 “Mystique” Cat-Eye: glossy ebony frames with upswept corners and delicate gold temple accents, channeling 1960s glamour in a modern editorial. The third dons SG005 “Round” Minimalist: ultra-slim gold metal rims encircling gradient rose-tinted lenses that catch the last rays of sun. Warm lens flares, crisp shadows, and a subtle breeze animate flowing hair and lightweight fabrics.

       "Campaign Rationale  \n",
       "– Market Alignment: Each style directly reflects the technical silhouettes, heritage nods and low-key luxe metals driving SS25 editorials and social media buzz.  \n",
       "– Inventory Efficiency: Current stock levels support a focused promotion that minimizes overstock risk while maximizing sell-through potential.  \n",
       "– Broad Appeal: These three silhouettes flatter a wide range of face shapes and lifestyle segments—from performance enthusiasts to fashion-minded trendsetters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Recommendation  \n",
       "Proceed with a coordinated digital, wholesale and retail campaign spotlighting these three styles. Leverage influencer partnerships and targeted social-ad creative to amplify runway credibility, and position our SKU selection as the definitive Summer 2025 eyewear edit.\n",

       "The phrase “Sunset Futurism” mirrors the image’s warm urban dusk lighting and sporty-technical wraparound shields, “Sculptural Shields” nods to the bold cat-eye and futuristic silhouettes, and “Minimalist Flair” captures the ultra-light, slim-rim trend with vibrant lens tints—perfectly aligning with the SS25 forecast and our three key styles.\n",

    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you have seen how to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **multi-agent LLM pipelines** to automate a creative workflow end-to-end.  \n",
    "- Combine **reasoning, tool-calling, and external data** to ground your outputs in reality.  \n",
    "- Apply multimodal models (like `gpt-4o`) that process **both text and images** for tasks such as generating campaign quotes.  \n",
    "- Extend the model’s abilities with tools (`tavily_search_tool`, `product_catalog_tool`) so your outputs are not only imaginative but also practical.  \n",
    "- Keep execution **transparent and debuggable** with structured logging and HTML-styled blocks.  \n",
    "- Deliver a polished, **executive-ready report** in Markdown format that blends insights, visuals, and justifications into a single artifact.  \n",
