    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As Andrew explained in the lecture, *planning with code execution* means letting the LLM **write code that becomes the plan itself**.  \n",
    "Compared to plain-text or JSON-based plans, this approach is more expressive and flexible: the code not only documents the steps but can also execute them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will implement this design pattern in practice.  \n",
    "Instead of asking the LLM to output a plan in JSON format and then manually executing each step, we will allow it to **write Python code** that directly captures multiple steps of a plan. By executing this code, we can carry out complex queries automatically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things concrete, we simulate a **sunglasses store** with an **inventory** of products and a set of **transactions** (sales, returns, balance updates). This example shows how the LLM can generate code to query or update records, demonstrating the flexibility of this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Lab Overview\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1. Create simple **inventory** and **transaction** datasets.  \n",
    "2. Build a **schema block** describing the data.  \n",
    "3. Prompt the LLM to **write a plan as Python code** (with comments explaining each step).  \n",
    "4. Execute the code in a sandbox to obtain the answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explain** why letting the model write code (instead of JSON or plain text plans) enables richer, more flexible planning.  \n",
    "- **Prompt** an LLM to produce Python code with step-by-step comments that both documents and executes the plan.  \n",
    "- **Run** the generated code safely in a sandbox and interpret the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates how *Code as Action* can outperform brittle tool chains and JSON-based planning approaches."
